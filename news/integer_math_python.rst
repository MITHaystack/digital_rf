**Added:**

* Add new `digital_rf_get_timestamp_floor` and `digital_rf_get_sample_ceil` functions that can be used to convert between a timestamp and sample index, given the rational sample rate. These have been made available so that users can perform these calculations in a way that is consistent with what is done internally.
