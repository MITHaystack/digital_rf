This recipe is primarily used for CI builds, although it is possible to use it
locally from a checked-out git repository with "conda-build".

Developers
**********

CI builds use this recipe and the settings in ../../conda-forge.yml. Any changes
to the recipe should be accompanied by running "conda-smithy rerender
--feedstock_config .conda-forge.yml -c auto" so that the generated build scripts
are updated when necessary.

Consult the conda-forge.yml file for additional documentation.
