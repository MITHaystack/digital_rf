	Release 2.0  - Dec 30, 2015

Release 2.0 was a major update to Digital RF, in that file and subdirectory names were made predictable.
To do this, each file and subdirectory now contains a set range of samples, and files and subdirectories
will no longer have set number of samples when data is gappy.  This greatly simplified the read api, since
globs were no longer needed to find the data files that need to be opened; instead all needed file names
can be derived.

	Release 1.1.1  - Aug 4, 2014

Release 1.1.1 differs from Release 1.1 in that the python read methods were changed.  The method read_vector
now returns all data in format numpy.complex8, no matter how the data was stored in the underlying Hdf5 file.
A new method, read_vector_raw duplicates the old read_vector method, returning data in the format stored in
the Hdf5 raw files.  The method read_vector_c81d that returns data as a single subchannel in numpy.complex8
format still exists, but issues a UserWarning recommending use of the other methods.

	Release 1.1 - July 7, 2014

Release 1.1 differs from Release 1.0 in that the directory naming convention was changed from HH:MM:SS since certain
file systems disallowed colons in directory names.  This affected both the read and write API's.

	Release 1.0 - May 29, 2014

Release 1.0 is the first major release of the C and Python API's supporting the Digital RF HDF5 raw data format.
